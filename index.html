    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <img src="./images/fifa.jpg">
    <p>I was born in Jackson, Tennessee on August 24, 2001. I attend Madison Academic High School and am in the tenth grade.</p>
    <p>I love taking coding class at my school. It is the first class that I look foward to going to each day. I have learned so
       much in the course of just a few months, now making websites and understanding their language such as HTML and CSS is 
       like a second language to me.</p>
    <p>I plan on going into the technology world as a career when i am older. I hope to go to a good college so I can run 
       track/cross country and study subjects such as web design and computer programming. Hopefully, I will learn as much
       as I can in high school so I will be prepared for college.</p>

    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <h4>•Reggi's BBQ Website</h4>
    <p>This site was created by me and my partner, <a href="https://myportfolio2-willwilliams02.c9users.io/index.html">Will Williams</a>. We made the site for Reggi's BBQ restaurant in Jackson, Tennessee
       This was our submission for the DevCatalyst competition. We started in late January of 2018 and took us through early April
       to finish. This was my first website created and I enjoyed working on it.</p>
    <p>The website features a fully-responsive and modern design. It includes various upgrades compared to their previous website. 
       Our site was also chosen as a finalist in the DevCatalyst competition. You can <a href="https://lukepjontek.github.io/reggis-bbq/">view our site here!</a></p>
    <h4>•Digital Portfolio</h4>
    <p>After creating my website for Reggi's BBQ, I began work on my Digital Portfolio... which is what this website is. This
       This website is a visual representation of projects, jobs, and achievements that I have obtained over my course of high
       school and beyond.</p>
    <p>I have used all of the skills that I learned throughout making my Reggi's BBQ website and have put them into a fresh
       new site. Working on a second website, of which its contents was dictated by me, helped my refine my coding skills
       as well as teach me new ones that i can use again.</p>

    <h1>Extracurricular Activities</h1>
    <h4>•Cross Country</h4>
    <p>I am on my high school's cross country team. I have been running for Madison since I came here as a freshman in 2016.
       I first started running when I was in seventh grade at North East Middle School and have ran cross country every year
       since then. I enjoy running and I hope that I will be able to run in college.</p>
    <h4>•Track and Field</h4>
    <p>I first started running track the winter of my freshman year at Madison. This is my second year running track. I am able to
       do both cross country and track because the seasons do not interfere with each other.</p>
    <h4 class="mouse">•Other Sports</h4>
    <p>I have also done other sports such as soccer, basketball, and football in middle school. I do not play these sports anymore
       because I have either lost intrest or no not have enough time to play them.</p>

    <h1>Job and Volunteer Experience</h1>
    <h4>•Lifeguarding</h4>
    <p>In the summer of 2017, I got my first job. It was a lifeguarding job at my neighborhood's pool. In order to become a lifeguard,
       I had to become Red Cross certified in lifeguarding. In the training, I learned how to preform CPR, rescue drowning victoms,
       administer first aid, as well as other requirements that are necessary in becoming a Red Cross certified lifeguard.</p>
    <h4>•Volunteering</h4>
    <p>At Madison Academic, we must obtain at least 60 hours of community service volunteer hours to graduate. I thought it would be 
       fun to volunteer at the church I attend, Fellowship Bible Church. Almost every Sunday, I help opperate the cameras that we use 
       to livestream the church service to social media platforms such as YouTube and Facebook. It is a fun way to get service hours
       and I would probably volunteer to do this even if I did not need to get community service hours.</p>
